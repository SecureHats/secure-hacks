# SecureHats - Capture the Hat

## About this project

To create more awareness on security in the Microsoft Azure Cloud, I have started a this project. <br />
The idea is to periodically, hopefully weekly, create a new challenge that will give some more insights on the configuration risks. <br />
All challenges are based on the CTF style, but because it is part of the SecureHats community if will be a CtH (Capture the Hat). <br /><br />
During the challenges the player will be guided through different Azure resources. For now this will mostly be Cloud native resources that won't cost to much. This because I am running it in my own environment.

<br />
Everyone should be able to complete the challeges without being a certified hacker. <br />
Information to resolve the challenges is public available, but requires some googling sometimes.<br />
<br />
Once a new challenge is available, it will be published on Twitter using the tag #SecureHats.<br />
The table below will also be updated with a new link once the new challenge is ready.<br />
<br />

> The flag from challenge [SH-001](challenges/SH-001/readme.md) is required to continue with the next challenge!
