# SecureHats - Capture the Hat

## About this project

To create more awareness of security in the Microsoft Azure Cloud, I have started this project. <br />
The idea is to periodically create a new challenge that will gain access to another Azure resource. <br />
Everyone should be able to complete the challeges without being a certified hacker. <br />

## Challenges

| name | resourcetype | challenge | description |
| - | - | - | - |
| SH-001 | Storage | SAS Tokens | over privileged token |
| SH-002 | Azure Function | FunctionApp | Exfiltrate data |
